This basic project is part of the ODIN web development course. 

Through this I got experience setting up a website with an index.html base page, as well as adding additional branched webpages. 
In these webpages I used HTML's fundamental elements, link anchors and images. I also got some experience maintaining this project on GitHub

Moving forward, I hope to develop webpages that are more styalised and more professional looking. 
I am also excited to discover the potential of CSS and JS and the functionality these languages will help me add to websites.
